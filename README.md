*file code/mynewlp has the updated version of Project phase2.

Scenario: 
The Rare Bookstore client’s have indicated that they will require the ability to view a list of their books. The ability to search through the list to find books based on their price, Author’s name, and Book’s title has been requested. They would also like to sort the list based on genere.
 
Solution:
Flexbox was used to create a viewing system for the employee’s to view a list of the books. 
Employees will be able to search and sort the list books by way of the inventory system.
A prototype webage will display these possibilites via pages.github.io(using HTML/CSS). 
Changes: 
Each file has been updated to included what the client wants which is overall ease of use system for tracting inventory, customers and how the employees are using that system.
